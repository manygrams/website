I'm currently working on a bookmarkletÂ for Carbitrage and Kijiji integration. If you are searching for a new car on Kijiji and you stumble upon one of interest, you can click the bookmarklet, which will direct you to a page with the estimated market price for that specific car. It also calculates how over- or under-priced that car is.

You can find the bookmarklet [here](http://carbitrage.com/main/bookmarklet/).
