We have an XBOX360 at work, and the game that is played the most often is definitely NHL2013. Since I'm a professional data nerd, I wanted to see how I compared to the other players. As such, I wrote a simple Rails web application to track games and thus rankings/stats of everyone who plays at work.

It definitely needs a lot more work, but I'll be adding to it over time. It just works for now.
