I finally did it! I wrote my first Ruby gem.

I was finding the need to insert some JSON data into a development instance of [Vertica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertica) for some testing at work. This tool will take some JSON data, guess the schema, and insert that data into Vertica. Nothing complicated, but a simple tool like that didn't exist yet. Plus, the name I went with (insertica) came to mind as soon as I began writing the tool, so it would have been a crime to not finish it!

You can find the project [here](https://github.com/manygrams/insertica).
